colorMatrix
===========
colorMatrix is an [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) script that helps you to transform an image from one RGB color space to another by the use of a color matrix.

To find out the usage of JavaScript scripting in ImageJ [please check this ImageJ page](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/developer/javascript.html).

To install the colorMatrix script you just have to download it and drop it in the *plugins* folder under the ImageJ installation folder. On Windows OS the *plugin* folder is usually in:

    C:\Program Files\ImageJ\plugins

However, to keep a tidy plugin folder structure we recommend you to create a new folder under the plugin one &mdash;for example RGB Scripts&mdash; and leave there the script.
